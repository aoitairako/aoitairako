### Hi, I'm Aoi.

I build things that make someone's day a little better.

I'm not an engineer. I'm someone who wants to contribute —
and technology finally became a tool anyone can pick up.
So I picked it up.

---

I start with one question: **who does this make happier?**

If the answer is nobody — or just me — it probably doesn't need to exist.
You'd be surprised how often that's the case.

**What you build matters less than why you build it.**
Two people can do the exact same thing.
One does it to be seen. The other does it because someone needed it.
Same output. Completely different meaning.
I'm interested in the meaning part.

**Your "why" can only come from you.**
Not borrowed. Not inherited.
Most people never ask — they follow expectations, opinions,
whatever voice is loudest, and forget they had a question to begin with.

**Simplicity is the final form of complexity.**
Cutting-edge technology can be impressive.
But I'd rather build something essential —
simple, focused, nothing wasted.

**AI is a partner, not a replacement.**
The one thing AI can't do is decide *why* something should exist.
That belongs to humans. Nothing matters more.

**Building isn't the goal. Helping someone is.**
If it takes time, that's fine — as long as it serves someone.
If what I built stops serving that purpose,
I'll let it go and build something better.
No attachment. No ego.

#### What I'm working on

These aren't just projects. They're how I think.

- **[CONTEXT.md](https://github.com/aoitairako/context-md)** — Every project has files that explain *what* it does. None explain *why* it exists. I thought that was worth fixing.
- **The I** — If AI clients come and go, what stays? The meaning layer. That's what I'm trying to build. *(Private — still figuring things out.)*

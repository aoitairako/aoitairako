### Hi, I'm Aoi.

System architect. Quality over speed.

I build tools and standards at the intersection of AI and human intention.

#### Currently working on

- **[CONTEXT.md](https://github.com/aoitairako/context-md)** — A file standard for the one question no project file answers: *Why does this exist?*
- **The I** (private) — An AI-agnostic master system. Universal agent instructions that work with any AI, not just one vendor.

#### Philosophy

Every project has files that describe **what** it does and **how** it works. Almost none describe **why** it exists. I think that's the most important file — and the one only a human can write.

*Quality over Speed. Minimal Viable Excellence.*
